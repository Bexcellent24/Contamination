# Contamination

*Contamination* is a survival-strategy game built in Unreal Engine as part of a university project.  
The game explores a uniquely South African issue â€” failing sewage infrastructure and water quality â€” through interactive gameplay that raises awareness of the risks and challenges.

## Gameplay
You play as a sewer technician tasked with repairing a maze-like underground system.  
- Navigate sewer tunnels to locate and repair leaks  
- Repairs require specific items, but you have limited inventory slots  
- Return to base to collect more supplies, but every delay increases the rising water level and worsens your sickness  
- Manage your **sickness level** as dirty water contaminated with E. coli slowly poisons you  
- The map uncovers as you explore, revealing both opportunities and threats  
- Beware of **monsters** formed from dirt and decay that patrol the tunnels â€” they will attack if they see you  
- Itâ€™s a constant **risk vs reward**: you can leave at any time, but failing to meet at least half of your repair quota means losing your job  

## Development Notes
This project was created as part of a **university coursework project**.  

Key focuses included:  
- **UI Systems** â€“ custom-built Unreal Engine UI for player information and interaction  
- **Audio Design** â€“ use of local sound for immersive sewer navigation  
- **Modular Systems** â€“ flexible inventory and interaction systems built with interfaces  
- **Animation Systems** â€“ animation blueprints and blend spaces for smooth character behaviour  
- **Clean Code Practices** â€“ consistent use of **SOLID principles** and design patterns throughout
